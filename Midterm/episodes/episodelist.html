                        <p>
                            Espers fight with supernatural phenomena that can't be explained by science. 
                            Reigen Arataka, who runs the Spirits and Such Consultation Office, is one of those psychics--well, a fake one. 
                            His only hope is a dull middle schooler named Mob.

                            During the cold open, delinquents from Salt Middle School are in a turf war with a rival school. 
                            When the rival delinquents are unable to win, they call for their leader, Teruki "Teru" Hanazawa. 
                            In spite of being physically unimposing, Teru disposes of the Salt delinquents with ease.
