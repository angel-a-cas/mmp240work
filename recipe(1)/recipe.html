    <h1>WE MAKING PASTELITOS DE QUESO, HIP HIP HOORAY</h1>
    <marquee><p>good luck</p></marquee>
    <h2>What we gon need for this sweet dominican treat</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Get those dough discs, Goya Empanda is what I usually pick</li>
      <li>Get Queso de frier (a white cheese for frying), Tropical is my go to</li>
      <li>Something to fry it in of course, Pan or Deep Fryer works well</li>
      <li>Oil to fry with</li>
      <li>a fork</li>
    </ol>
    
  </br>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>get your disc and lay it flat on anything, i like cutting boards but that's just personal preference</li>
      <li>get your frying cheese and either chop it up or hope you can fit it in</li>
      <li>like a sandwich get another disc on top</li>
      <li>with your fork you're going to start to press down on all around the edges</li>
      <li>once you repeat this process for how many you want start to prep the fryer</li>
      <li>Once that oil looks prepped I like to wait 2-5 minutes (depending on what im using)</li>
      <li>In a pan I like to do 5 minutes as I like to flip to make sure i get that golden brown. However I haven't done it much with a deep fryer so I'm guessing based of these results we put it for 3 minutes</li>
    </ol>
